# About project Zoe

Project Zoe is a church management centered on what's at the heart of all ministry - people. The platform simplifies the process of managing people and their relationships between each other and the church, keeping track of data across the organization and creates a foundation for adding new features that are specific to your church.

# The tech

This repo holds the Project Zoe church relationship management system (RMS) client. 
It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Setup / Installation ðŸš€

1. Clone the repository:

> `git clone https://github.com/kanzucodefoundation/project-zoe-client.git`

2. Checkout to the Develop branch

> `git checkout develop`

3. Install dependencies with npm version 6.14.5:

> `npx npm@6.14.5 install`

4. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.sample`.

> You should set the `REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=local` if you are running the app locally.

4. Finally, spin up the project with:

> `npm start`

**Please Note:** 
- If you don't have `node.js` installed, check out this guide https://nodejs.org/en/

## Github Actions
This repo is automatically deployed to the prod server using github actions. We create an `.env` file during the deployment process. Rather than add each environment variable to the file one by one, we copied a complete `.env` file and encrypted it using base64. We use the command:

```
openssl base64 -A -in .env -out .env.prod.encrypted
```

We then get the contents of `.env.prod.encrypted` and add them as a Github Action variable called `PROD_ENV_FILE`
